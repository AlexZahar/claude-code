# How Multi-MCP Prevents Duplicate MCP Servers

## The Protection Mechanism

### 1. **Single Proxy Instance Check**
When Claude Code starts (via SessionStart hook), it checks if Multi-MCP proxy is already running:
```bash
# From boardlens-dev-startup-hook-multi.sh:
if ~/.claude/multi-mcp-service.sh status | grep -q "âœ… Running"; then
    log_message "âœ… Multi-MCP proxy running and accessible"
else
    log_message "ðŸš€ Starting Multi-MCP proxy..."
    ~/.claude/multi-mcp-service.sh start
fi
```

### 2. **No Individual MCP Servers Started**
Your Claude settings.json only has ONE MCP entry:
```json
"mcpServers": {
  "multi-mcp-proxy": {
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/sse",
    "description": "Multi-MCP Proxy aggregating all MCP servers"
  }
}
```
- **No individual server entries** = Claude can't spawn them
- All Claude instances connect to the SAME proxy endpoint

### 3. **Proxy Manages MCP Lifecycle**
The Multi-MCP proxy (running on port 8080):
- Starts MCP servers ONCE when proxy starts
- All Claude instances share these servers via SSE
- If proxy is already running, new Claude sessions just connect

## Slash Commands Now Available

You can now use these commands in any Claude session:
- `/mcp-start` - Start Multi-MCP proxy
- `/mcp-status` - Check proxy status
- `/mcp-restart` - Restart proxy (if issues)

## What Happens When You Open New tmux/Claude Sessions

1. **First Claude session:**
   - SessionStart hook runs
   - Checks Multi-MCP proxy â†’ Not running
   - Starts proxy â†’ Proxy spawns 8 MCP servers
   - Claude connects to proxy

2. **Second/Third/Nth Claude session:**
   - SessionStart hook runs
   - Checks Multi-MCP proxy â†’ Already running âœ…
   - Skips startup (no new servers spawned)
   - Claude connects to SAME proxy

## The Key Insight

**Before Multi-MCP:**
```
Claude 1 â†’ Spawns 8 MCP servers (400MB)
Claude 2 â†’ Spawns 8 MORE servers (400MB)
Claude 3 â†’ Spawns 8 MORE servers (400MB)
Total: 24 processes, 1.2GB RAM
```

**With Multi-MCP:**
```
Claude 1 â†’ Connects to proxy â†’ Proxy spawns 8 servers (400MB)
Claude 2 â†’ Connects to proxy â†’ Uses SAME 8 servers
Claude 3 â†’ Connects to proxy â†’ Uses SAME 8 servers
Total: 8 processes + 1 proxy, 475MB RAM
```

## Verification

Run this to confirm no duplicates:
```bash
# Should see only ~8 MCP processes (not 24+)
ps aux | grep "@modelcontextprotocol" | grep -v grep | wc -l

# Should see only 1 Multi-MCP proxy
ps aux | grep "multi-mcp.*main.py" | grep -v grep | wc -l
```

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Proxy crashes:** Next Claude session auto-restarts it
2. **Port conflict:** Service script checks before starting
3. **Stale processes:** Stop hook cleans up on exit
4. **Manual intervention:** Use slash commands if needed

The system is designed to be self-healing and prevent the exact duplication issue you were concerned about!
