## ⚡ What This Enhanced System Provides

### Automatic Workflow Intelligence
- **Prevents common mistakes** before they happen
- **Routes tools intelligently** (Serena for code, Context7 for docs)
- **Builds knowledge** across all your coding sessions
- **Enforces best practices** automatically

### 13 Custom Slash Commands
```
/remember [text]        /recall [query]         /compact
/gemini-overview       /gemini-analyze         /gemini-security  
/gemini-performance    /context7-docs          /gemini-review
```

### Persistent Memory System
- Remembers everything across sessions
- Searchable knowledge graph
- Automatic context building
- Project-aware intelligence

## 📱 Signal Integration (Original Feature)

When you start a new Claude Code session, I will:

1. **Send a notification** to your phone that a new session has started
2. **Include the project name** you're working on
3. **Request permission** via Signal (Y/N) for sensitive operations like:
   - Database migrations
   - File deletions
   - System configuration changes
   - Production deployments

### Signal Setup Requirements
1. Signal must be configured in `~/Projects/boardlens/boardlens-python-api/`
2. Environment variables set:
   - `SIGNAL_SENDER` - Your signal-cli number
   - `SIGNAL_RECIPIENT` - Your personal phone number

### Testing Signal Integration
```bash
cd ~/Projects/boardlens/boardlens-python-api
python3 -c "from signal_notify import notify_task_complete; notify_task_complete('Test from Claude Code')"
```

## 🧪 Quick System Test

```bash
# 1. Verify environment
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# 2. Test memory system  
claude code
/remember This is a test of the memory system
/recall test

# 3. Success if you see your memory returned!
```
