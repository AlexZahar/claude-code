# 🚀 Claude Code Enhanced Configuration

## 🎯 The Ultimate Local AI Development Stack

Transform your Claude Code CLI into a powerful development environment featuring three systems working in perfect harmony:

### The Trinity of Power:

**1. 🧠 Graphiti Memory (Neo4j)**
- Persistent knowledge graph capturing all work
- Auto-saves discoveries, solutions, and patterns  
- Searchable context across sessions
- Optimized chunking preventing timeouts

**2. 🔄 Multi-MCP Integration**
- **Serena MCP**: Semantic code understanding & RAG codebase search
- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: Complex reasoning connected to graph memory  
- **Additional MCPs**: Context7, GitHub, Filesystem, and more

**3. ⚡ Smart Automation Hooks**
- Pre-tool validation prevents wrong tool usage
- Impact analysis shows dependencies before changes
- Quality checks review code for consistency
- Memory capture saves everything important

## 📦 Core MCP Components (Local Tools)

This system integrates three powerful local MCP servers:

| Component | Purpose | GitHub Repository |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| **🧠 Graphiti** | Local graph memory with Neo4j backend | [getzep/graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti) |
| **🔄 Sequential Thinking** | Complex reasoning connected to graph memory | [arben-adm/mcp-sequential-thinking](https://github.com/arben-adm/mcp-sequential-thinking) |
| **⚡ Serena** | Local RAG codebase & semantic search | [oraios/serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena) |

> **⚠️ Important Setup Notes:**
> - **Graphiti**: Do NOT set up as MCP with stdio - the MCP connection is broken. Use our local scripts with SSE instead (included in this package)
> - **Sequential Thinking**: Set up as standard MCP server  
> - **Serena**: Set up as standard MCP server

> **Why Local MCP Tools?**
> - 🔒 **Complete Privacy**: All data stays on your machine
> - ⚡ **Zero Latency**: No network calls for core operations  
> - 🧠 **Superior Context**: Semantic search beats regular text search
> - 💾 **Persistent Memory**: Knowledge graph grows with every session

## 💡 How It All Works Together

```
User Query → Memory system retrieves relevant context
          → Hooks analyze impact and prevent mistakes  
          → Serena provides precise semantic code operations
          → Insights saved back to memory for future use
          → Knowledge compounds over time
```

### The Magic:
- **Memory-Augmented Reasoning**: Never forgets solutions or patterns
- **Semantic Precision**: Code changes are surgically precise  
- **Continuous Learning**: Every session makes the system smarter
- **Zero Cloud Dependency**: 100% local, private, and fast
- **Automatic Context**: Hooks capture everything important

## 🚀 Quick Setup

```bash
# Install to ~/.claude directory
git clone https://github.com/AlexZahar/claude-code.git ~/.claude
cd ~/.claude

# Set your API key  
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Initialize Neo4j memory system (requires Docker)
# NOTE: This uses our custom Graphiti integration, NOT the broken MCP stdio connection
./initialize-graphiti.sh

# Test it works
claude code
```
